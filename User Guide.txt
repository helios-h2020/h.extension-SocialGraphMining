======= Installments =======
Capture
		You can take over Installments, such as Barracks, Mines, Fields, etc. You can also
		take over Machine units abandoned in the map. 

Spawn
		Some installments (e.g. Barracks) produce Minions at frequent intervals to bolster
		your ranks. Minions are produced only as long as the total number of units is less
		than a Cap value. You start with 20 cap, but some installments (e.g. Fields) can
		increase this value.

======= Units =======
Units of enemy players attack each other on sight. They bear the color of their respective
player both on their images and their health bars.

Action Frequency (Freq) 
		Units can attack at fixed intervals.
		On average once every 45 / Freq seconds, non-machine units will also
		regain one health, up to their starting health.

Dodge
		Units can dodge attacks with a certain probability (up to 95% chance).
		This is typically zero by default but is further increased in certain
		terrains, such as mountains and deserts. Machine units (e.g. Tanks) are
		not able to dodge and will always take damage regardless of the terrain.

		[TIP] Try to strategically station your units at the edges of special
		terrain to make sure

Sight & Range
		Going higher up on mountains increases the line of sight and wading through
		water decreases it. The attack range of units is smaller than their sight range,
		yet increases proportionately to it.

Promotion
		Non-machine units have a chance to be promoted to Veteran status whenever
		they kill an enemy. This increases by 80% their basic dodge ability, as well
		as their size and sight.

		[TIP] Since the basic dodge chance stacks with the terrain, Veterans often
		end up enjoying its maximum 95% in special terrains, thus becoming very
		difficult to kill there.

		Very rarely, a Veteran unit will be further promoted to Hero. Heroes gain
		another 10% (for a total of 90%) increase to their basic dodge ability,
		as well as further increses in size and sight. Furthermore, they gain twice
		as match as Freq stat.

		[TIP] Heroes can often fend off disproportionate odds through sheer combat
		prowess and it is interesting to try to micromanage their actions to take
		advantage of their increased range, sight, damage output and survivability,
		as well as to make them retreat when low on health to wait until some of it
		is regained.



======= Terrains =======
Plains
		Can find Fields and Railguns (in addition to other things)
		Beware of Bisons, Wolves and hordes of Rats. Bisons leave behind a Hide
		installment, which can increase your minion Cap and Wolves can be subdued
		into becoming Dogs to be captured.

Deserts
		Small dodge boost and small speed reduction. Can find Machines and Installments
		with a much higher chance compared to other terrains.
		
		[TIP] Deserts are ideal for exploration.

Mountains
		Increased dodge and sight but reduced speed the higher you go. Can find Mines
		and Prisons and occasionally a discarded Machine. Beware of Yeti and Angry Snowmen
		that often spawn on snowy peaks. Angry Snowmen can be subdued into simple Snowmen
		that can be captured.
		
Islands
		Slightly reduced speed. They are surrounded by water, in which speed and sight
		is small, so it is easier to defend from incoming occupants bank. Can find Tents,
		Prisons and Machines.
